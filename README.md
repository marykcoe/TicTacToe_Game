# TicTacToe_Game
Implementation of the MiniMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning as a computer opponent for Tic Tac Toe.

For more information on the MiniMax algorithm, see [Lecture 6 of the MIT Opencourseware series Artificial Intelligence](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/resources/lecture-6-search-games-minimax-and-alpha-beta/). For details on how to implement it, see [this video by Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI&t=415s).

To play, create an instance of the class. 

Enjoy the game!
